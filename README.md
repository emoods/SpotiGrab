# SpotiGrab (fork of https://spotifyrecorder.codeplex.com/)  thx to the hard work!

SpotiGrab is a simple spotify recorder for windows (.net 4). Is records the output directly. No Stereo Mix Device for recording is needed. 
Is uses lame encoder to convert to mp3. 

It supports a simple way to skip songs that are under a certain length to remove commercials
